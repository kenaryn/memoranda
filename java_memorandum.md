### Static class
A static class is NOT instantiated to call its method. At least one static method causes the class it belongs to to be static.

### power
`Math.pow(<base>, <exponent>)`
x ^ 0 = 1
x ^ 1 = x   

### float/double precision
- `float`: 32 bits. Mantissa: 23 bits (about 7 decimal digits), exponent: 8 bits, sign: 1 bit
- `double`: 64 bits. Mantissa: 52 (about 16 decimal digits), exponent: 11 bits, sign: 1 bit

### Default value
- Boolean (object): `null`
- boolean (primitive): `false`

### Primitives
All primitives are signed. *e.g.* `byte`'s type range value is between -128 and 127.
